labelbuddy (0.0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A search bar has been added to the documents list in the
    "Labels & Docs" tab, to filter documents based on their content.
  * It is now possible to rename labels from the "Labels & Docs" tab,
    while keeping the corresponding annotations.
  * The extra data input now suggests completions: all the extra
    data values for the same label as the selected label in the
    current document. This can be used for example to implicitly link
    annotations by giving them the same extra data, using the extra
    data as an id.
  * A list of annotations is now displayed on the right in the
    "Annotate" tab. It provides an overview of annotations in the
    current document and helps navigate them (clicking on an
    annotation in the list scrolls the text so it becomes visible).
  * Selecting a label while an annotation is selected now creates a
    new annotation on top instead of replacing the selected annotation.
  * Selecting a label that already exists at the current position
    activates the corresponding annotation.
